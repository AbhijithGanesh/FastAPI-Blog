# FastAPI-Super-Blog-Site
This repository contains the files for my Flask Blog site which will be a simple yet holistic blog site using a micro-database called SQLITE. 


## What is the idea behing this app?
I've always loved the idea of a blog site but wanted to make a simple solution towards it, I will be using the following frameworks and libraries for this project:
  - FastAPI (for routing and back-end processing)
  - SQITE (for storing data efficiently)
  - Django (for ORM)
  - React (for front-end designs and User Interface)
